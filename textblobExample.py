# MS 548 Advanced Programming Concepts and AI. 
# Python project 1

# I estimate the most lengthy part of this assignment is understanding TextBlob.
# Part of the issue I expect to have is understanding the usage of the libraries.
# I also had trouble with getting everything setup too. Coming up with useful functions 
# was a little difficult too as some of the stuff seemed trivial and could be done
# without the use of the textblob library, but it would be significantly more code to do so. 
# There was also some getting used to the Python language. some of ti was pretty trivial but 
# printing some of the values was a little more difficult than I expected.

# I was right about textblob being the most cumbersome. Overall the entire project took just
# under 5 hours from start to finish which is what I expected it to take. 

"""
For the next iteration of my project, I;d like to try and use Tkinter for a GUI for my application. 
I think I can extend a lot of the functionality of the menus to work on larger sets of data like from
a website. I can possibly add something that will allow me to search for certain words in say a blog 
post and thatword can be user customizable. I'd like to also have the output read back to the user as 
well and possibly have audio cues when processing a response that is correct or incorrect.Â
